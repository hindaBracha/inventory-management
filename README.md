## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/inventory-management.git
```

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
cd inventory-management
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Activate the virtual environment and install the required packages:

For Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

Set up the database by applying the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Create a Superuser (Admin)

To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the instructions to set up your admin credentials.

### Step 6: Start the Development Server

Run the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can now access the application and the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.

## How to Use

Once the server is running:

### Log in to the Django Admin Panel:

- Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin).
- Log in using the superuser credentials you created.

### Manage Inventory:

- Add, edit, or delete products through the admin interface.
- Create categories to organize products.

### Access the API:

- The system provides a RESTful API for interacting with the inventory data programmatically.
- API endpoints are available for managing products, categories, and stock levels.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used to build the system.
- **Django**: Web framework that powers the application.
- **SQLite**: Default database (can be swapped for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
- **Django REST Framework**: For building the API (if applicable).

## UI/UX Design

The **Inventory Management System** was designed with a strong focus on **usability** and **visual clarity**. Below are the key principles followed during the UI/UX design process:

### 1. **Clean and Intuitive Layout**:
   The system's interface is clean, with a minimalist approach that ensures users can easily navigate the platform without feeling overwhelmed. 
   
   - The **Admin Panel** is the primary interface, with a left-side navigation bar and content areas for managing products, categories, and stock levels.
   - **Product and Category Cards** are displayed in a grid layout for easy access and quick data manipulation.
   - **Buttons and Forms**: All forms and buttons are designed to be large, visible, and easy to interact with, ensuring a smooth user experience even on mobile devices.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly across various screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and smartphones. This ensures that inventory management is accessible on-the-go.

### 3. **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Important actions (such as "Add Product" or "Delete Product") are highlighted with clear and distinct colors, allowing users to quickly locate critical options.
   - Data tables and charts are arranged logically, with bold headings and clear labeling, ensuring easy scanning of data.

### 4. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Interactive elements such as buttons and forms provide **immediate feedback**. For instance, after adding a product, the system offers a confirmation message or error alert, ensuring users understand the result of their actions.

### 5. **User-Centered Design**:
   - The system is built with the user in mind, ensuring that all interactions are streamlined. The interface minimizes the number of clicks required to perform an action, with easy navigation between sections.
   
   - The design also takes into account accessibility, ensuring that text is legible, and interactive elements are clearly distinguishable.
